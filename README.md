## Instructions on how to run the program

3. Type **python a1_code.py**
4. Press Enter.

#### Note
* Alternatively, you may want to simply run the **a1_code.py** file on any IDE of your choice
* By default, the program will run in its entirety for **both** datasets
* If you wish, to run only it for only one of them, simply comment out the relevant parts as indicated in the main method

## Libraries used
* matplotlib
* pandas
* seaborn
* collections
* sklearn

## Important notes
* The professor allowed us to export the metrics and the confusion matrices in their own respective files (e.g. .txt, .png, etc.) 
* When asked to plot the distribution of the number of instances in each class (part 1), the file(s) to be used for this task were not mentioned. Hence, I used the training, validation and testing sets to represent those distributions
